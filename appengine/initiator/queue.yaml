# Configuration rationale:
#
#  name
#  Set to the name of the Task Queue instance.
#
#  rate
#  Set to 60/m to align with external API quota (60 http requests / min).
#
#  bucket_size
#  Set to 8 as we have 8 instances of App Engine handlers.
#
#  task_retry_limit
#  Set to a moderate value to limit retries in case of technical issues.
#
#  min_backoff_seconds
#  Set to a reasonable delay to allow other tasks to run while pending.
#
#  max_backoff_seconds
#  Set to a moderate limit so temporarily failed tasks cannot cause long delays.
#
#  target
#  Set to the name of the service that handles pushed tasks.
#
#  max_concurrent_requests
#  Set to 8 as we have 8 available CPU cores to run (each GAE is single core).
